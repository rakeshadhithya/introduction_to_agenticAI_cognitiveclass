# When to Call Tools Manually
# -------------------------------

# Purpose
# -------------------------------
# - Explore how LLMs suggest actions using tools.
# - Understand agents’ role in automating tool execution.
# - Learn why manual invocation provides greater control.

# Context
# -------------------------------
# - LLMs can suggest tools + parameters to perform tasks (e.g., weather API with location & date).
# - Agents can automatically execute tools without human intervention.

# Risks of Automatic Execution
# -------------------------------
# - Safety: unintended actions could cause problems (e.g., financial data errors).
# - Cost: unnecessary API calls can increase expenses.
# - Accuracy: incorrect parameters or misuse can lead to wrong results.
# - Oversight: no manual check to ensure alignment with goals.

# Manual Tool Invocation
# -------------------------------
# Benefits:
# 1. Safety – prevent unintended actions.
# 2. Cost control – avoid unnecessary API calls.
# 3. Accuracy – ensure correct parameters and correct tool usage.
# 4. Oversight – validate inputs/outputs, ensure alignment with intentions.
# 5. Reliability – maintain precision in results and operations.

# How it Works
# -------------------------------
# 1. User prompt → LLM suggests tool + parameters.
# 2. Human reviews suggestion.
# 3. Human executes tool manually.
# 4. Results validated and returned.

# Key Takeaways
# -------------------------------
# - Automation is efficient but carries risks.
# - Manual invocation offers control, safety, and precision.
# - Evaluate LLM tool suggestions to ensure reliability.
# - Choose manual vs automated approach based on task sensitivity and desired oversight.
