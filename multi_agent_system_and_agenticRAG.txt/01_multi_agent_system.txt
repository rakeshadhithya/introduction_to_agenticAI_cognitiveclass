# Agentic AI & Multi-Agent LLM Systems
# -------------------------------

# 1. Agentic AI Overview
# -------------------------------
# - Agentic AI goes beyond traditional chatbots.
# - Unlike simple Q&A systems, agentic AI can:
#   • Set goals
#   • Make decisions
#   • Kick off workflows
#   • Operate with minimal human supervision

# 2. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
# -------------------------------
# - Why multiple agents?
#   • A single agent handling all tasks faces context overload and role confusion.
#   • Multi-agent systems allow specialization: data retrieval, analysis, writing, critiquing.
#   • Modular and scalable; easier to debug and improve.
# - Examples:
#   • Market research report: research agent, analysis agent, writing agent, critique agent.
#   • Customer support: request classification, FAQ retrieval, reply drafting, escalation.

# 3. Communication Patterns Between Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Sequential / Pipeline:
#   • Agents work one after another (assembly line style)
# - Parallel with Aggregation:
#   • Agents work simultaneously; a central agent aggregates results
# - Interactive Dialogue:
#   • Agents converse to clarify and refine outputs

# 4. Tools and Frameworks for Coordination
# -------------------------------
# - Protocols: MCP (Model Context Protocol), IBM ACP
# - Frameworks: LangGraph, CrewAI, BeeAI
# - Benefits:
#   • Standardized communication
#   • Easier orchestration of complex workflows
#   • Integration with external tools

# 5. Risks of Agentic AI
# -------------------------------
# - Under specification: broad goals without step-by-step guidance
# - Autonomous long-term planning without human oversight
# - Potential for decision errors, security vulnerabilities, and misinformation

# 6. Governance & Safety
# -------------------------------
# - Multilayered approach:
#   • Technical safeguards (guardrails to stop runaway processes)
#   • Human-in-the-loop checks for sensitive actions
#   • Data privacy controls
#   • Auditability (trace decisions)
#   • Role-based access (limit agent capabilities)
# - Organizational responsibility:
#   • Monitoring and red-teaming
#   • Ongoing supervision and intervention when needed

# 7. Future Outlook
# -------------------------------
# - AI is trending toward more collaborative and capable multi-agent systems.
# - Opportunities: customer service, healthcare, legal tech, and more.
# - Key challenge: balance capability with safety and human alignment.
