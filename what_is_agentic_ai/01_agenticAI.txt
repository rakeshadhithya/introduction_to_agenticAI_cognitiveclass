# Agentic AI (Lesson 1)
# -------------------------------

# AI Agent:
# - A system that perceives its environment, decides actions,
#   takes those actions, and learns from outcomes.
# - Proactive (pursues goals) vs. Generative AI (reactive).

# Generative AI:
# - Waits for a prompt (e.g., chatbots, image generators).
# - Produces output but doesn’t pursue multi-step goals.

# -------------------------------
# Example
# -------------------------------
# Vacation Planning:
# - Single model: summarize places to visit.
# - Agent: ask preferences, search flights, compare hotels,
#   check weather, adapt if preferences change.

# -------------------------------
# Agents vs. Workflows
# -------------------------------
# - Workflow: clear, predictable, step-by-step processes.
# - Agent: handles ambiguity, adapts when tasks change.
# - Rule of thumb: predictable → workflow, messy/unpredictable → agent.

# -------------------------------
# Types of Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Reflex agent: simple rules ("if cold → turn on heat").
# - Model-based agent: tracks state over time.
# - Goal-based agent: plans to achieve goals.
# - Utility-based agent: weighs trade-offs.
# - Learning agent: improves with experience.
# - Examples: thermostat = reflex, self-driving car = goal-based/learning.

# -------------------------------
# When Not to Use Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Simple, repeatable tasks (summarization, data entry).
# - When consistency is critical (e.g., medical tasks).
# - Agents require more resources, can be costly & unpredictable.

# -------------------------------
# Decision Framework (4 questions)
# -------------------------------
# 1. Is the task ambiguous or unpredictable?
# 2. Is the value worth the extra cost?
# 3. Does the agent meet minimum skill requirements?
# 4. What is the risk if it fails?
# → If low value or high risk, use a simpler tool/workflow.

# -------------------------------
# Future of Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Growth in complex decision-making tasks.
# - Hybrid systems (workflows + agents) will dominate.
# - Humans will stay in the loop for now.
