# Agentic AI (Lesson 1)
# -------------------------------

# AI Agent:
# - A system that perceives its environment, decides actions,
#   takes those actions, and learns from outcomes.
# - Proactive (pursues goals) vs. Generative AI (reactive).

# Generative AI:
# - Waits for a prompt (e.g., chatbots, image generators).
# - Produces output but doesn’t pursue multi-step goals.

# -------------------------------
# Example
# -------------------------------
# Vacation Planning:
# - Single model: summarize places to visit.
# - Agent: ask preferences, search flights, compare hotels,
#   check weather, adapt if preferences change.

# -------------------------------
# Agents vs. Workflows
# -------------------------------
# - Workflow: clear, predictable, step-by-step processes.
# - Agent: handles ambiguity, adapts when tasks change.
# - Rule of thumb: predictable → workflow, messy/unpredictable → agent.

# -------------------------------
# Types of Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Reflex agent: simple rules ("if cold → turn on heat").
# - Model-based agent: tracks state over time.
# - Goal-based agent: plans to achieve goals.
# - Utility-based agent: weighs trade-offs.
# - Learning agent: improves with experience.
# - Examples: thermostat = reflex, self-driving car = goal-based/learning.

# -------------------------------
# When Not to Use Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Simple, repeatable tasks (summarization, data entry).
# - When consistency is critical (e.g., medical tasks).
# - Agents require more resources, can be costly & unpredictable.

# -------------------------------
# Decision Framework (4 questions)
# -------------------------------
# 1. Is the task ambiguous or unpredictable?
# 2. Is the value worth the extra cost?
# 3. Does the agent meet minimum skill requirements?
# 4. What is the risk if it fails?
# → If low value or high risk, use a simpler tool/workflow.

# -------------------------------
# Future of Agents
# -------------------------------
# - Growth in complex decision-making tasks.
# - Hybrid systems (workflows + agents) will dominate.
# - Humans will stay in the loop for now.

# -------------------------------
# Generative AI vs Agentic AI
# -------------------------------

# Generative AI:
# - Reactive system: waits for a user prompt.
# - Produces content (text, images, code, audio).
# - Based on patterns/statistical relationships learned in training.
# - Ends at generation → no further steps without human input.
# - Humans direct, curate, refine outputs.
#   Example: YouTuber → AI helps draft scripts, suggest thumbnails,
#   generate background music, but human controls/edits.

# Agentic AI:
# - Proactive system: pursues goals through actions (multi-step).
# - Life cycle:
#     1. Perceive environment
#     2. Decide action
#     3. Execute action
#     4. Learn from output → repeat
# - Minimal human intervention.
#   Example: Personal shopping agent → searches products,
#   tracks prices, manages checkout, coordinates delivery.

# -------------------------------
# Common Foundation
# -------------------------------
# - Large Language Models (LLMs) power both.
#   - Chatbots: LLMs
#   - Images/Audio: diffusion models
# - For agents: LLM = reasoning engine.
# - Enables "Chain of Thought" reasoning:
#   - Breaks complex tasks into smaller logical steps.
#   - Like humans thinking out loud before acting.

# -------------------------------
# Example: Conference Planning Agent
# -------------------------------
# - Step 1: Understand requirements (size, duration, budget).
# - Step 2: Research venues that fit parameters.
# - Step 3: Check availability for short-listed venues.
# - Step 4: Continue reasoning + refine → then act.
# → Internal "self-dialogue" using gen AI for reasoning.

# -------------------------------
# Key Distinctions
# -------------------------------
# Generative AI:
#   - Reactive
#   - Produces content
#   - Needs constant human input
# Agentic AI:
#   - Proactive
#   - Pursues goals with multi-step actions
#   - Learns/adapts with minimal human input

# -------------------------------
# Future of AI
# -------------------------------
# - Strongest systems = hybrid (generative + agentic).
# - Intelligent collaborators:
#   - Know when to generate options (exploration).
#   - Know when to act and commit (execution).
# - Example: Agent might generate story chapter in background
#   while preparing logistics for another task.
