# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Overview
# -------------------------------

# Purpose
# -------------------------------
# - MCP is an open-source standard for connecting AI agents to data sources (databases, APIs, local files, code).
# - Simplifies communication between agents (LLMs) and multiple data sources.

# Components
# -------------------------------
# 1. MCP Host
#    - Top-level application (e.g., chat app, code assistant in IDE).
#    - Includes MCP client(s).
#    - Sends user queries and receives final results.
#
# 2. MCP Client
#    - Embedded in the host.
#    - Facilitates communication with MCP servers.
#
# 3. MCP Server
#    - Connects to actual data sources (databases, APIs, local files, code).
#    - Executes requested tools/actions.
#    - Can have multiple servers connected to a single host/client.

# MCP Protocol
# -------------------------------
# - Serves as the transport layer between host/client and servers.
# - Standardizes communication regardless of type of database, API, or data source.

# How It Works (Example)
# -------------------------------
# 1. User asks a question in MCP host (chat app, code assistant).
# 2. MCP host retrieves available tools from MCP server(s).
# 3. Host/client sends question + tools to the LLM.
# 4. LLM decides which tools to use.
# 5. MCP host/client calls the appropriate MCP server to execute tools.
# 6. MCP server executes actions (e.g., query database, call API, run code) and returns results.
# 7. Results are sent back to the LLM.
# 8. Final answer is returned to the user in the host application.

# Benefits
# -------------------------------
# - Standardizes access to diverse data sources for AI agents.
# - Supports multiple servers and multiple hosts/clients.
# - Works with relational & NoSQL databases, APIs, local files, and code.
# - Facilitates integration with LLMs to automate tool selection and execution.
# - Especially useful for building agentic systems (e.g., code assistants).

# Recommendation
# -------------------------------
# - If building AI agents, learn and implement MCP to streamline connecting data sources.
# - Useful even if not directly building agentsâ€”supports client applications that interact with agents.
